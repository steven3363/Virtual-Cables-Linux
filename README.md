# Virtual-Cables-Linux
Scripts to enable virtual cables in Linux. In particular for OBS to be used in conference software such as Jitsi and Zoom

I have included 2 scripts one for PulseAudio and another for Pipewire. 

Simply download and run the apporpiate file for your system.

For the pipewire version I found that I needed to install 'pulseaudio-utils'
fedora "sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils"
 Ubuntu or most apt based systems "sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils"
 
also 'PulseAudio Volume Control' (assuming you have pulseadio installed.
 fedora "sudo dnf install pavucontrol"
 Ubuntu or most apt based systems "sudo apt install pavucontrol"
